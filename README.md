TODO: Their costs????? Gold or wood
**Peasant**
![Peasant.PNG](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysp62fjk236510b/Peasant.PNG?dl=0&raw=1)
They do all the construction of the buildings and the mining of wood and gold.
Peasants are trained from the hard-working and stouthearted citizens that live in the numerous kingdoms of Lordaeron. By mining gold and harvesting lumber to meet the everincreasing needs of the fighting force which must push back the unrelenting Horde, they are the backbone of the Alliance. 
Trained not only in the construction and maintenance of the myriad buildings found in every community, but also those necessary to wage war, they take great pride in the invaluable service they provide. Roused by tales of the Orcish atrocities in Azeroth, these Peasants have learned to use both pick and axe for their own defense if threatened
**Footman**

The most basic of the attacking units.
Footmen are the initial line of defense against the Horde. Arrayed in hardened steel armor, they courageously wield broadsword and shield in hand-to-hand combat against their vile Orcish foes. The valorous Footmen are ever prepared to heed the call to arms.
**Elven Archer**

What do you do if you have a lot of gold at your disposal? Train some elves for your defence. 
Out of the mysterious forests of Quel’thalas come the Elven Archers to aid the Alliance in its darkest hour. Descendants of the elder race of Lordaeron, these sylvan woodsmen are unmatched in their use of the bow. Unencumbered by helm or heavy armor, Archers are keen of eye and fleet of foot. These Elves have long been embroiled in a bloody conflict with
the hated Trolls of Lordaeron and are swift to let loose a rain of arrows upon any foe, including those that attack from the skies above
